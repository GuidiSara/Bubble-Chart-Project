## Project's descriptions

The project represents a dataset of 10 data-case that every data-case has 3 positive variables.
This dataset is rappresent through a bubbble chart that the first quantitive variable v1 is used for X, the second quantitive variable v2 is used for Y and the third quantitive variable v3 is used for circle's radius.
When you clicked on x or y axis, suppose that of the x, the quantitive variale used for circle's radius (at this moment the third quantitive variable v3) takes the place of the quantitive variable used in that axis, suppose v1. By continuing to click on the axes, the variables still switch roles with the same rule.
